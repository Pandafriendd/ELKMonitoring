Indexing the threat data into Elasticsearch by Logstash. Run the following command:
```
bin/logstash -f test9.conf
```
This command will index crimeserver threat data into Elasticsearch. Mention that you should use your own api key to access the data. To create your api key, visit [here](https://community.blueliv.com/#!/get-started/).
## Config Logstash
To config Logstash, run this command:
```
bin/logstash -f test10.conf
```
Note that you need to config the directory of your log data files based on your setups. 
## Visualization of threat data and log data
Here are some example dashboards we create. You can create and customize your own depending on your need.
